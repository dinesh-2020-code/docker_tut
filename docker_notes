Docker: Docker is a container technology. A tool for creating and managing containers.

Container: A standardized unit of software
        -> A package of code and dependencies to run that code (e.g., NodeJS code + NodeJS runtime)
        -> The same container always yields the exact same application and execution behaviour! No matter where or by whom it might be executed.
Containers: Packages that contains application or the env to run the code. (running unit of software)
            -> running instances of images

Images: Templates/blueprints for Containers
    -> sharable 
    -> Contains code + required tools/runtime

    -> For ex: NodeJS App Code + NodeJS Environment

Finding / Creating Images

    We need an image!
        -> Use an existing, pre-built image -> head to dockerhub for pre-built images
